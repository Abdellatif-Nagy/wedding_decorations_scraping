This repository contains the code for a new web scraping project using Selenium. The project is designed to scrape data from  wedding decorations websites in Australia and save the data in a spreadsheet The code is written in Python 3 and uses the Selenium WebDriver to automate the web scraping process in headless mode.

this is a real Upwork job(screenshots are attached), my proposal was rejected but I intend to finish the project to acquire new skills.

the interesting task in this project is how to find each wedding decoration website by searching Google by its name and location.

features:
1- using selenium
2- the project is divided into small functions
3- adding Loading Bar

The scraped data will be saved in a spreadsheet named wedding_decorations.xlsx
